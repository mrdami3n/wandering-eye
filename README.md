# The Vague Reminder
A strange and unsettling desktop companion that is perpetually disappointed in you.

It lives on your desktop as a single, unblinking eye that silently follows your every move. It doesn't help you. It doesn't entertain you. It simply watches, and occasionally, it will offer a "reminder" in the form of a vague, unsettling, or completely useless notification.

This application is a piece of interactive, absurdist art. It is fully functional, but its function is to be strange.

## Features
An Unblinking Gaze: An eye that lives on your desktop and follows your cursor's every move. It knows what you're doing.

Vague & Unsettling Reminders: Receive periodic notifications with "helpful" reminders such as "They know." or "Are you sure you locked it?".

Customizable Appearance: Right-click the eye to open a color picker and change the color of its iris. Match its mood to your own.

Repositionable: Don't like where it's staring from? Simply click and drag the eye to a new position on your screen.

System Tray Presence: Banish the eye from your sight, but it will continue to run silently in your system tray, ready to remind you of... something.

## Installation
